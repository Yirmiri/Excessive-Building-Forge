Literally just a secret .txt file of every single update's changelog

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Release 1.1.0 (1.19.4, 1.19.2 Forge)
Major Update!

  Additions
•   Added vertical stairs for all stair variants in vanilla + Excessive Building, do expect mod compat in the future aswell!
•   Added crafting table variants for each wood type
•   Added smooth stone tiles (more tiles coming soon in the future!)

  Changes
•   Fiery crystals clusters will spawn less frequently
•   Removed cobbled blocks from the natural blocks creative tab

  Bug Fixes
•   Cobbled granite, diorite, and andesite stairs, slabs, and walls can no longer be used as "stone crafting materials" (this allowed them to have the properties of normal cobblestone blocks, ex: stone age advancement,
repairing/crafting stone tools, and other stuff)
•   Piglins will now like golden brick block variants (stairs, slabs, walls, and the new vertical stairs)

  Notes
•   [IMPORTANT] This will be the last major update to support 1.19.4, 1.19.2, and 1.18.2, these versions will only be updated on occasion (possibly never at all) and will no longer be supported on every single content update
•   Changed Excessive Building logo
