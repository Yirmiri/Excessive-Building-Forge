Hello!, if you would like to create translations for the mod you are welcome to do so :), I am currently only fluent in English so I can't do anything outside of that. 
Any lang files that aren't en_us are not supported by me and I cannot gurantee they are 100% accurate or will be maintained.
If you decide to help out with translating the mod you can either send the lang file via our Discord server or GitHub page. 
You will be rewarded with credit & a translator cape.

If you have a cape and you would like it removed or you cannot see it in game you can contact me via Discord or Twitter :) (Discord: yirmiri | Twitter: @Yirmiris)

Translator Credits:
- en_us translated by "@yirmiris"
- uk_ua translated by "@un_roman_"
- ru_ru translated by "@bricker_man"
