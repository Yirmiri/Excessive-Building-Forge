Hello!, if you would like to create translations for the mod you are welcome to do so :), I am currentlyonly fluent in English so I can't do anything outside of that. 
Any lang files that aren't en_us are not supported by me and I cannot gurantee they are 100% accurate.
If you decide to help out with translating the mod you can either send the lang file via our Discord server or GitHub page. 
You will be rewarded with credit & a contributor cape which will be seen when using the Aurynium mod (mod is currently under development).

If you have a cape and you would like it removed you can contact me via Discord or Twitter :) (Discord: yirmiri | Twitter: @Yirmiris)
